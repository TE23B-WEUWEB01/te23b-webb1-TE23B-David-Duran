    <p>Kyrie Andrew Irving, born March 23, 1992. Is an American professional basketball player for the Dallas  Mavericks of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He was named the Rookie of the Year after being selected by the Cleveland Cavaliers with the first overall pick in the 2011 NBA draft. An eight-time All-Star and three-time member of the All-NBA Team, Irving won an NBA championship with the Cavaliers in 2016. He is widely considered one of the best ball handlers of all time.</p>
    <p>Irving played one year of college basketball for the Duke Blue Devils before joining the Cavaliers in 2011. He won the Most Valuable Player (MVP) award for the 2014 All-Star Game.

After another Finals appearance in 2017, Irving requested a trade and was dealt to the Boston Celtics. He played with the Celtics for two seasons, after which Irving signed with the Brooklyn Nets as a free agent in 2019. After four seasons with the Nets, he requested a trade and was dealt to the Dallas Mavericks in 2023, where Irving reached his fourth NBA Finals with the team in 2024.

In February 2020, he was elected as one of the seven vice-presidents of the National Basketball Players Association, replacing Pau Gasol.[6] Irving's decision not to get vaccinated for COVID-19 led to him missing the majority of the 2021â€“2022 NBA season.</p>

Some of these conspiracies, including tweeting a link to the movie Hebrews to Negroes: Wake Up Black America, have been characterized as antisemitic.
